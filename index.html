      <h1>Brand & Social Media Audit</h1>
      <p>@Cargoboxxpress</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Branding & Visual Identity</h2>
      <p>Develop vertical and icon-only versions of the logo to allow better visual adaptability across different platforms. A full brand guideline with colours, fonts, and logo rules will elevate presentation.</p>
      <div class="highlight"><strong>Scenario:</strong> When customers see the same visual look on a delivery box, Instagram post, and website, they remember you easier—even after just one order.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Feed Design & Content Layout</h2>
      <p>Move away from the square-only format and use vertical (4:5) posts to better utilise screen space. Break down complex information into bite-sized carousels. Keep the feed visually calm—less clutter equals more attention.</p>
      <div class="highlight"><strong>Tip:</strong> Use pinned carousels to act like a storefront window—summarise what you offer and how to order in 3–5 slides.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Engagement & Insights</h2>
      <p>Low comment activity makes it hard to learn what your audience really wants. Run polls and Q&A in Instagram Stories to directly engage followers. Offer a small incentive (free delivery, branded merch) for completing a 1-minute survey.</p>
      <div class="highlight"><strong>Real-world example:</strong> One client gave away a keyring and got over 100 survey responses that reshaped their product line.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Competitor Highlights</h2>
      <p>Each of these competitors has carved a presence in their own way. Not necessarily to copy—but to observe:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>ASAP Express:</strong> Leans heavily into showcasing customer satisfaction through visuals and testimonials.</li>
        <li><strong>Agape Courier:</strong> Uses Reels and explainer content to simplify their service offering for viewers.</li>
        <li><strong>Reliable Courier JA:</strong> Focuses on deal-driven posting and regularity to keep their name top-of-mind.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Suggestions & Insights</h2>
      <p>Below are a few directional suggestions based on current best practices and competitor activity. These are meant to inspire—not set in stone. The most effective strategy will come once we've had a chance to meet, understand the nuances of your company objectives, and define your unique brand voice together.</p>
      <div class="card-list">
        <div class="card">Start a "Cargoboxxpress Explained" series—each post answering a different common shipping question visually.</div>
        <div class="card">Highlight service areas with geo-tagged photos or graphics to make it clearer where you deliver and collect.</div>
        <div class="card">Run a recurring “Delivery of the Week” or “Surprise Shoutout” to boost retention and reward frequent customers.</div>
        <div class="card">Where possible, include people—staff, drivers, customers—so your posts feel relatable and warm. Faces make content more human and memorable.</div>
        <div class="card">Inject stories. Instead of just saying "we deliver fast," show the journey of a package or a customer's first-time experience. These stories stick with people and get reshared naturally.</div>
        <div class="card">Even as a small team, lean into your size. Don’t shy away from being seen. Instead, build an intimate community that roots for you. Feature your founders. Collaborate on posts. Bring followers along your journey of growth—that transparency and authenticity will set you apart in a sea of sameness.</div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Next Steps</h2>
      <p>We propose setting up a collaborative session between our team and yours to align on your brand’s content tilt, visual direction, and posting rhythm. From there, we’ll map out a content calendar, develop the core branding assets, and identify small but meaningful actions that can drive real business outcomes—like building trust, increasing order frequency, and turning casual customers into repeat loyalists.</p>
